## The Blog

I have a long-time hobby of writing and I believe that writing can help me to organize my thoughts. This blog is mainly for me to organize and share the knowledge in the field of CS. After moving to Melbourne, I decided to use English to write a whole new blog, for language practices as well. 

By the way, I used to write a blog in Chinese: [Archive](Archive). Feel free to check it out.
