## Who am I

Hi! I am **Chew (Qiuyi)**. I'm currently a master's student at the **University of Melbourne** studying Computer Science. My current interests include **distributed system**, **computation theory** and **programming languages**. Feel free to contact me if you are interested. 

## The Blog

I agree that writing can help me to organize my thoughts and this blog is mainly for me to organize and share the knowledge in the field of CS. I used to write a blog in Chinese: [Archive](https://excitedspider.github.io/archive.excitedspider.github.io/). After moving to Melbourne, I decided to use English to write a whole new Blog.
