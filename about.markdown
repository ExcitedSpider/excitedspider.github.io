## The Blog

I have a long hobby of writing and I believe that writing can help me to organize my thoughts. This blog is mainly for me to organize and share the knowledge in the field of CS. By the way, I used to write a blog in Chinese: [Archive](Archive). After moving to Melbourne, I decided to use English to write a whole new blog, for language practices as well.
